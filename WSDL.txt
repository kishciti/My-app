JXL library doesnot support  .csv and .xslx formats, which is the format used by Excel-2010. hence, use Excel 97-2003 which is .xls foramatted and is supported by JXL library. or else if you want to use excel-2010, use APACHE POI(XSSFWorkbooks) instead of JXL. For using .csv format, google for CSVReader libraries.
